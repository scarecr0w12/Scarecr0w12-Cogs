# Refactor Notes: Modular Mixins (Unreleased)

This refactor splits the monolithic `skynetv2/skynetv2.py` into focused mixin modules to improve maintainability without changing runtime behavior.

## Summary of Changes

- Added `memory.py` (`MemoryMixin`) for memory context helpers.
- Added `tools.py` (`ToolsMixin`) for tool registry and enable/disable helpers.
- Added `stats.py` (`StatsMixin`) for rate limit enforcement and stats summary generation.
- Added `listener.py` (`ListenerMixin`) for passive `on_message` handling.
- Updated `skynetv2.py` to inherit from these mixins in order: `ToolsMixin, MemoryMixin, StatsMixin, ListenerMixin, commands.Cog`.
- No command names, arguments, or behaviors changed.
- No new dependencies introduced.

## Rationale

- Reduce cognitive load in the primary cog file.
- Prepare for future expansion of tools and memory subsystems.
- Allow isolated testing of usage/rate logic.

## Testing Checklist

1. Load cog: `[p]load skynetv2`.
2. Run chat: `/ai chat "hello"` (works, no errors).
3. Stats: `/ai stats` returns same structure as before.
4. Memory show/prune still functional.
5. Tools list: `/ai tools list` unchanged output.
6. Passive listening (if enabled) still responds.

## Documentation Updates

- Core architecture description remains valid; added this file as supplemental note.
- `commands.md` does not need changes (no surface changes) but references to internal organization can note modularization if desired.

## Rollback Plan

Revert to previous commit containing monolithic `skynetv2.py` if unexpected side effects appear.

## Future Work

- Add per-tool usage counters in `StatsMixin`.
- Consider extracting policy enforcement into its own mixin if expanded.
